*minimu9-ahrs* is a program for reading data from the "Pololu MinIMU-9":http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1268 over I²C.  Currently, only the MinIMU-9 v1 and MinIMU-9 v2 are supported, but there are plans to add support for the MinIMU-9 v3.  The program can output the raw sensor data from the magnetometor, accelerometer, and gyro or it can use that raw data to compute the orientation of the IMU.  This program was designed and tested on the "Raspberry Pi":http://www.raspberrypi.org, but it will probably work on any embedded Linux board that supports I²C.  A Debian package is available for easy installation and the "minimu9-ahrs source code":https://github.com/DavidEGrayson/minimu9-ahrs is on github.
