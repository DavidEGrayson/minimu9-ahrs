# minimu9-ahrs

**minimu9-ahrs** is a program for reading sensor data from the Pololu MinIMU-9
and similar boards over I²C.  It supports the following sensor chips:

* LSM6DSO
* LSM6DS33 accelerometer and gyro
* LIS3MDL magnetometer
* LSM303D magnetometer and accelerometer
* LSM303DLHC magnetometer and accelerometer
* LSM303DLM magnetometer and accelerometer
* LSM303DLH magnetometer and accelerometer
* L3GD20H gyro
* L3GD20 gyro
* L3G4200D gyro

This program works with any board that has a magnetometer, acceleromter, and a
gyro from the list above.  This includes the following Pololu products:

* MinIMU-9 [v0][mv0], [v1][mv1], [v2][mv2], [v3][mv3], [v5][mv5], [v6][mv6]
* AltIMU-10 [v3][av3], [v4][av4], [v5][av5], [v6][av6]
* [Balboa 32U4 Balancing Robot Kit][balboa]

The program can output the raw sensor data from the magnetometor, accelerometer,
and gyro or it can use that raw data to compute the orientation of the IMU.
This program was designed and tested on the [Raspberry Pi], but it will probably
work on any embedded Linux board that supports I²C.

## Getting started

### Enabling I²C

First, you need to make sure your system supports I²C.  Try typing
`ls /dev/i2c*`: if you don't see a device there named something like
`/dev/i2c-1` then your I²C is not enabled properly.

On a **Raspberry Pi running Raspbian**, you should run `sudo raspi-config`
and browse its menus to find the option to enable I²C.

If that does not work, here are some other things to try: Add `i2c-bcm2708` and
`i2c-dev` to to the list in `/etc/modules` so they get loaded automatically when
you boot up.  Add the line `dtparam=i2c1=on` to the bottom of
`/boot/config.txt` to enable the Raspberry Pi's external I²C interface.  After
making these changes, reboot.  If you run `lsmod | grep i2c` you should see the
modules mentioned above, which means they were successfully loaded into the
kernel.  If you run `ls /dev/i2c*` you should see `/dev/i2c-1`.

If this information doesn't work for you, please search Google for tips about
how to enable I²C for your particular board and your particular Linux
distribution.

Here are some other related resources that might be useful for you when

* [Guide to interfacing a Gyro and Accelerometer with a Raspberry Pi](https://ozzmaker.com/berryimu/)

### Managing device permissions

After enabling the I²C devices, you should set them up so that your user has
permission to access them.  That way, you won't have to run `sudo`.

First, run `groups` to see what groups your user belongs to.  If `i2c` is on the
list, then that is good.  If you are not on the `i2c` group, then you should add
yourself to it by running `sudo usermod -a -G i2c $(whoami)`, logging out, and
then logging in again.  If your system does not have an `i2c` group, you can
create one or use a different group like `plugdev`.

Next, run `ls -l /dev/i2c*` to make sure that your I²C devices have their group
set to `i2c`.  The group name is shown in the fourth column, and will usually be
`root` or `i2c`.  If the devices are not in the `i2c` group, then you should fix
that by making a file called `/etc/udev.d/rules.d/i2c.rules` with the following
line in it:

    SUBSYSTEM=="i2c-dev" GROUP="i2c"

After making this file, you can make it take effect by running
`sudo udevadm trigger` (or rebooting).

If you get an error about permission being denied, double check that you have done these steps correctly.

### Soldering

The MinIMU-9 and AltIMU-9 boards come with male header pins, and you will need
to solder these into the board in order to make a solid connection.

### Wiring

You will need to power your IMU board and connect it to the I²C bus of your
embedded computer board.  The correct connections for the Raspberry Pi and a
MinIMU-9 are listed below:

| Raspberry Pi pin | MinIMU-9 pin |
|------------------|--------------|
| GND              | GND          |
| 3V3 Power        | VDD          |
| GPIO 2 (SDA)     | SDA          |
| GPIO 3 (SCL)     | SCL          |

Below is a [picture][wiring_pic] with a MinIMU-9 v2 showing how to make those
connections:

[![][wiring_pic_small]][wiring_pic]

You will need four female-female jumper wires designed for 0.1"-spaced pins.
Pololu's [Female-Female Premium Jumper Wires][ffwires] work well.

### Determining which bus to use

The default I²C bus used by this program is `/dev/i2c-1`.
On most Raspberry Pi boards, this bus is accessible on the GPIO connector.

If you want to use a different bus, you should make a configuration file
in your home directory named
`~/.minimu9-ahrs` with a single line of the form `i2c-bus=BUSNAME`, where
`BUSNAME` is the full path to the bus you want to use.

For example, to use `/dev/i2c-3` by default, the config file should read:

    i2c-bus=/dev/i2c-3

If you are not sure which bus to use, you could try running `i2cdetect` on each
available bus as described below.

### Checking your setup

After you have enabled I²C, given yourself the proper permissions, soldered the
MinIMU-9, and connected it to the Raspberry Pi, you should check your setup by
running `i2cdetect`.  Try running `i2cdetect -y N`, where `N` is the number of
the I²C bus you want to use (typically 1 or 0).  The output should look similar
to this:

```
$ i2cdetect -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00:          -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1d -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6b -- -- -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

The exact output will depend on the type of IMU
you are using, but the important thing is that the body of the printed table
should contain a few hex numbers representing the addresses of I²C devices that
were detected on the bus.

If the `i2cdetect` command is not recognized, you should install the `i2c-tools`
package.  On Raspbian, you can run `sudo apt-get install i2c-tools` to install
it.

If you do not see a few hex numbers in the body of the table, then make sure
your soldering and wiring are correct and try selecting a different bus by
changing the bus number argument `N`.

If you get a permission denied error, make sure you have configured the device
permissions properly as described above.

If you get a "No such file or directory" error referring to your I²C device,
make sure that you have properly enabled I²C as described above.

### Building from source

To build `minimu9-ahrs`, you first need to install some libraries that it
depends on.  On Raspbian, you can install these dependencies by running:

    sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-program-options-dev

Then, to build `minimu9-ahrs`, navigate to the top-level directory of the source
code and then run this command:

    make

Finally, to install minimu9-ahrs onto your system, run:

    sudo make install

I no longer distribute Debian packages for this program, so I recommend building
it from source as described here.

### Looking at raw values

As a first test, you should look at the raw readings from the sensors on your
IMU to make sure it is OK.  Run `minimu9-ahrs --mode raw`.  The output should
look something like this:

```
  -1318   -3106   -1801     1896    1219    3679        5      18       3
  -1318   -3106   -1801     1898    1200    3681        0      24      -1
  -1318   -3106   -1801     1899    1200    3688       15      17       2
  -1309   -3105   -1799     1874    1201    3671       17      20      -1
  -1309   -3105   -1799     1898    1214    3663       11      15      -2
```

**Yes, there will be noise in all the readings, even if your IMU is not moving
at all.** That is totally normal.

This output consists of three vectors.  From left to right they are the raw
magnetometer reading, the raw accelerometer reading, and the raw gyro reading.
Each vector consists of three integers, in X-Y-Z order.  You should turn the
device and make sure that the raw readings change correspondingly.  For example,
when the X axis of the board is pointing straight up, the accelerometer's X
reading (the 4th number on each line) should be positive and the other two
components of the acceleration should be close to zero.

### Calibrating

The magnetometer will need to be calibrated to create a mapping from the
ellipsoid shape of the raw readings to the unit sphere shape that we want the
scaled readings to have.  The calibration feature for the `minimu9-ahrs` assumes
that the shape of the raw readings will be an ellipsoid that is offset from the
origin and stretched along the X, Y, and Z axes.  It cannot handle a rotated
ellipsoid.  It can be informative to run `minimu9-ahrs --mode raw > output.tsv`
while moving the magnetometer and then make some scatter plots of the raw
magnetometer readings in a spreadsheet program to see what shape the readings
have.

To calibrate the magnetometer, run `minimu9-ahrs-calibrate` and follow the
on-screen instructions when they tell you to start rotating the IMU through as
many different orientations as possible.  Once the script has collected enough
data, it saves the data to `~/.minimu9-ahrs-cal-data` and then runs a separate
Python script (`minimu9-ahrs-calibrator`) to create a calibration.

The Python script previously had a complicated algorithm powered by SciPy that
would take about 20 minutes to run and was not reliable.  Currently, the script
just uses a very simple algorithm that finds the minimum and maximum values of
each axis of the magnetometer and uses those as the calibration values.  This is
probably not the best way to calibrate your magnetometer; there are more
advanced ways that might work better.

The `minimu9-ahrs-calibrate` script saves the calibration file to
`~/.minimu9-ahrs-cal`.  The calibration file is simply a one-line file with 6
numbers separated by spaces: minimum x, maximum x, minimum y, maximum y, minimum
z, maximum z.  These numbers specify the linear mapping from the raw ellipsoid
to the unit sphere.  For example, if "minimum x" is -414, it means that a
magnetometer reading of -414 on the X axis will get mapped to -1.0 when the
readings are scaled.

### Looking at Euler angles

Run `minimu9-ahrs --output euler`.  It will print a stream of floating-point
numbers, nine per line.  The first three numbers are the yaw, pitch, and roll
angles of the board in degrees.  All three Euler angles should be close zero
when the board is oriented with the Z axis facing down and the X axis facing
towards magnetic north.  From that starting point:

* A positive `yaw` corresponds to a rotation about the Z axis that is
  clockwise when viewed from above.
* A positive `pitch` correspond to a rotation about the Y axis that would
  cause the X axis to aim higher into the sky.
* A positive `roll` would correspond to a counter-clockwise rotation about
  the X axis.

The way you should think about it is that board starts in the neutral position,
then the yaw rotation is applied, then the pitch rotation is applied, and then
the roll rotation is applied to get the board to its final position.

Look at the Euler angle output as you turn the board and make sure that it looks
good.
